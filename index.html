      <h2 class="modal-title">Workers Compensation Insurance</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>
        Workers' compensation is a required insurance program in most states that provides benefits to employees who are
        injured
        on the job. While each state has its own rules and regulations regarding workers' compensation, federal
        employees are
        covered under a separate federal program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether your business is small, medium, or large, keeping up with California's workers' comp laws and
        requirements is
        essential. This insurance covers various workplace injuries and conditions, such as accidents (like slips and
        falls),
        repetitive strain injuries, and even some illnesses caused by the work environment (e.g., lung or heart disease,
        stress-related health issues).
      </p>
      <p>
        Workers' compensation can provide coverage for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Medical expenses related to the injury or illness</li>
        <li>Lost wages</li>
        <li>Permanent injury compensation</li>
        <li>Retraining costs</li>
        <li>Survivor benefits if an employee dies on the job</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This insurance protects employees regardless of fault; it covers work-related injuries caused by anyone, whether
        it’s
        the employer, employee, a colleague, or a third party. However, workers' comp may not cover injuries if they
        involve
        intoxication, self-inflicted harm, violation of company policy, or if the injury is not job-related.
      </p>
      <p>
        Failing to carry workers' compensation insurance could expose your business to lawsuits, with potential
        financial
        consequences including medical costs, punitive damages, and lost wages. Requirements for providing workers'
        compensation
        vary depending on your business type, employee roles, and number of employees. 
        
        <p>For more details about workers'
        comp
        coverage in California, please call me at 818-919-2795 or email me at Mike@cpisgroup.com.</p>

      <p>
        General liability insurance protects businesses against claims of bodily injury (BI), property damage (PD),
        advertising injury, and personal injury (PI) resulting from your business activities, products, or property.
      </p>
      <p>
        This coverage helps manage various non-professional liability risks, providing protection for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bodily injury</li>
        <li>Property damage</li>
        <li>Medical expenses</li>
        <li>Personal and advertising injury (such as libel, slander, or copyright infringement)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Situations covered by general liability insurance include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A visitor slipping and injuring themselves on your premises</li>
        <li>An employee accidentally damaging a client’s property</li>
        <li>A fire on your premises causing damage to neighboring businesses</li>
        <li>Legal actions claiming that your advertisements were misleading</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Having general liability insurance is essential for businesses that interact with customers, vendors, or
        contractors, especially given today's heightened consumer expectations and awareness of legal rights. This
        coverage can help safeguard your business from financial losses due to lawsuits and may also be necessary to
        obtain certain licenses or contracts.

    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>
        If your business involves driving—whether it’s running errands, delivering goods, transporting equipment, or
        picking up clients—commercial auto insurance is a must. This insurance covers the costs of third-party bodily
        injury or property damage resulting from accidents involving your business vehicles.
      </p>
      <p>Coverage options include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bodily injury to others (excluding your employees)</li>
        <li>Property damage (to someone else's car, building, etc.)</li>
        <li>Pollution cleanup costs following an accident involving hazardous materials</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This insurance also covers legal defense costs if a third party decides to sue over an accident. The types of
        vehicles covered can vary, including personal vehicles used for business purposes, company cars, trucks, rented
        autos, and even mobile equipment in transit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Commercial auto liability insurance is a requirement in most states, with varying minimum coverage levels. It is
        advisable to obtain coverage that exceeds the minimum requirements to ensure adequate protection.
      </p>

        Umbrella and excess liability insurance are vital parts of a company's risk management strategy, providing extra
        protection when claims exceed the coverage limits of standard policies like general liability or auto liability.
        This coverage helps shield your business assets from potential loss.
      </p>
      <p>
Professional Liability Insurance can help cover claims and lawsuits outside the scope of general liability insurance. It
protects you in cases involving accusations such as:
      </p>
      <p>Why Choose Umbrella or Excess Liability Insurance?</p>
      <p>
        With lawsuits on the rise and growing consumer awareness, the risk of liability is higher than ever. Should a
        claim surpass your existing coverage, umbrella insurance can automatically extend protection, safeguarding your
        business assets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without this added coverage, you might be responsible for out-of-pocket expenses for legal fees, medical bills,
        or damages once your primary policies are exhausted. If you have no assets, courts may require repayment through
        future earnings.
      </p>
      <p>Customized Coverage:</p>
      <p>
        You can adjust your umbrella insurance to align with your business risks, asset value, and potential future
        income loss, ensuring the coverage evolves as your situation changes.
      </p>

      <h2 class="modal-title">Professional Liability Insurance</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>When your business provides expert services, your clients expect a high level of professionalism, and your work
        must meet industry standards, client agreements, and legal requirements. Failing to meet these expectations
        could result in legal claims or disputes. Professional Liability Insurance can help cover claims and lawsuits
        outside the scope of general liability insurance. It protects you in cases involving accusations such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Negligence</li>
        <li>Misrepresentation</li>
        <li>Failure to deliver services</li>
        <li>Breach of good faith</li>
        <li>Errors or inaccurate advice</li>
      </ul>
      <p>How Does It Work? Professional liability policies come in two main forms:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Claims-Made: Coverage applies if the policy is active when the incident occurs and when the claim is filed.
        </li>
        <li>Occurrence: Covers incidents that occurred while the policy was in effect, even if the business has since
          closed or changed.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The policy typically covers legal defense costs, judgments, and associated fees, but won’t cover intentional
        acts or non-financial damages. Deductibles can range from $1,000 to $25,000, depending on business size and
        risk.</p>
      <p>Do You Need Professional Liability Insurance? While some professionals, like doctors and lawyers, are required
        to carry this insurance, others—such as consultants, architects, accountants, and software developers—can
        benefit from its protection. Given the potential for costly lawsuits and damage to your business reputation,
        carrying professional liability insurance is advisable, even if not legally required. Please reach out to me at
        818-919-2795 or Mike@cpisgroup.com to discuss the right coverage for you.</p>

    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>As employment laws evolve and employees become more aware of their rights, businesses face an increased risk of
        employment-related claims. Today’s workforce is better equipped to seek compensation for alleged wrongdoings,
        such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bullying or harassment</li>
        <li>Sexual harassment</li>
        <li>Discrimination</li>
        <li>Unfair dismissal</li>
        <li>Retaliation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additional claims could include defamation, wrongful refusal to hire, invasion of privacy, or negligent
        evaluation. EPLI protects against financial burdens resulting from these claims and may cover costs associated
        with reputation damage, including hiring media, public relations, or security consultants to manage the fallout.
      </p>
      <p>Understanding the Policy: EPLI is generally written on a claims-made basis, meaning defense costs will reduce
        your policy’s limits—a key difference from general liability policies. EPLI does not cover bodily injury,
        property damage, or intentional wrongful acts. Costs vary based on factors such as employee numbers, company
        history, turnover rate, and existing company policies. EPLI can be added to a Business Owner’s Policy (BOP) or
        purchased as a stand-alone policy.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>Cyber-attacks and data breaches not only disrupt businesses but also bring substantial financial costs due to
        fines and legal expenses. Unfortunately, small businesses are often prime targets because they may not fully
        understand the risks or lack robust security measures. Cyber incidents can compromise your computer systems,
        expose employees and customers to fraud, and harm your business's reputation.</p>
      <p>Cyber liability insurance protects your company against internet-based risks involving sensitive information
        such as credit card details, Social Security numbers, and health records. While general liability policies
        typically cover bodily injury and property damage, they usually exclude cyber risks. Cyber insurance can fill
        this gap, providing coverage for direct losses to your business (first-party coverage) and third-party claims
        from clients or partners.</p>
      <p>Coverage varies by provider but typically includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Customer notification of data breaches</li>
        <li>System repair and data recovery</li>
        <li>Identity restoration for affected customers</li>
        <li>Forensic investigation to determine the cause and scope of the breach</li>
        <li>Business interruption and extortion costs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Cyber insurance helps you recover from attacks and may also include proactive security measures to reduce your
        risk of being targeted. To assess your cyber security needs, please call me at 818-919-2795 or email me at

    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>Rising healthcare costs and complex regulations make managing employee benefits challenging for businesses.
        Mike can help design a cost-effective group health insurance plan that not only meets regulatory requirements
        but also helps attract and retain skilled employees.</p>
      <p>Group health insurance policies, which cover multiple employees rather than just individuals or families,
        typically offer significant savings. Premiums are calculated based on the overall health of the covered group,
        often resulting in lower costs compared to individual policies.</p>
      <p>Common group health plan options include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs): Employees pay lower rates at network providers and share some costs
          if they go out-of-network.</li>
        <li>Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs): Employees use a network of providers without co-pays, but must pay
          the full cost if they go out-of-network.</li>
        <li>Fee-for-Service Plans: Employees can visit any provider, paying a portion of the bill while the plan covers
          the rest.</li>
        <li>Health Savings Accounts (HSAs): Deductible-based plans that activate once a savings account threshold is
          met, requiring out-of-pocket payments initially.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A well-structured group health plan can help reduce turnover, improve employee satisfaction, and lower overall
        costs. For guidance, contact me at 818-919-2795 or Mike@cpisgroup.com.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>Protecting your business's interests often involves securing surety or fidelity bonds.</p>
      <p><strong>Surety Bonds</strong><br>
        These bonds provide a financial guarantee that certain obligations will be met. If the principal fails to
        fulfill their duties, the surety compensates the obligee for the loss. Types of surety bonds include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>License and permit bonds</li>
        <li>Probate and court bonds</li>
        <li>Public official bonds</li>
        <li>Contract performance bonds, such as bid bonds, performance bonds, and payment bonds</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Fidelity Bonds</strong><br>
        These bonds cover losses due to employee theft or dishonesty. Unlike surety bonds, they function as insurance
        policies that protect against theft, fraud, forgery, and other dishonest acts by employees. Types of fidelity
        bonds are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Blanket Bonds: Cover all employees under a single policy, suitable for businesses with high turnover.</li>
        <li>Schedule Bonds: Cover specific high-risk employees, with coverage amounts based on their roles.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For more information on surety and fidelity bonds, please reach out to me at 818-919-2795 or
